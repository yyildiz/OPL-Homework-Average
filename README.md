# OPL-Homework-Average
You'd think that there would be an average of our grades displayed on Bottlenose... WRONG!    
This script simply scrapes the page and adds up your grades to find the total average.    
The average is based on total points per assignment so some assignments worth 200 points    
are weighed more than those out of 100.
